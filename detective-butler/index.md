__The Misadventures of Detective Butler__ is an interactive murder mystery game series. The first game in the series, __Maiden Voyage Murder__, was completed in August 2013 and is available for download below. The second game has been in development since November 2014 and is on track to be released sometime during Summer 2016. Unlike the first game, the second game is significantly larger and will consist of a game client that the player will use to download new chapters to their existing game, which will be released over time. Features new to the second game include a full 3D map system, evidence collection, and debate system.
