## Overview

As you might've noticed, updates have been quite slow recently. It's been hard to find time to make any progress, but I really do work on things every day. I should get better at posting updates and getting the word out, but I am doing everything I can to keep this train running without a hitch.

## General Updates

So, I've gone back and added a few of the Patreon posts. I'd actually been posting there for the past few months, but this place looks too barren. Since I'd opened them up to public viewing anyway, I figured I might as well migrate them all here.

Also, my stream schedule has once again changed a bit. Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays are for the C++ game engine, and Mondays and Fridays are for the Detective Butler DLC. Once we release the DLC, Mondays and Fridays will generally be reserved for other stuff I need to do, or other small side projects, just to keep things interesting. I've found that it's probably not the best idea to completely switch what I'm working on, so I hope that streaming specific content on specific days will work out better.

## Witch Doctor Kaneko

In June 2019's blog post I mentioned a C++ game engine as a side project. Well, it took off quite a bit and replaced Kaneko as the main project. I'll be using the C++ game engine to develop both Witch Doctor Kaneko and Detective Butler 2, as well as many other games in the future. Ultimately, I don't want to be limited by any other game engines out there, and I also want to grow as a developer. So far, working on this engine has been an incredible learning experience. I'm happy to say that we're at a point where we have the ability to build a game in our own engine and publish it to the world. Now we just need to go and do it!

As a quick side note, some people have asked me if I would open source the engine. I'm considering it, but I'd need to figure out the best license. I'm also considering releasing an engine exclusively for visual novel development, since I'd need to make one anyway for DB2 and there's not a whole lot of competition out there.

## Detective Butler DLC

Unfortunately, as you can tell, I wasn't able to finish the DLC by summer 2019. But the good news is that I'm still working on it and it's almost done. You can now view the [Steam store page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1110930/Detective_Butler_Maiden_Voyage_Murder__Choices_DLC/) for the Detective Butler DLC. I've set the release date to April 3, 2020, so please look forward to it then! You can read some more details about the DLC in this [Steam update.](https://steamcommunity.com/gid/103582791458349982/announcements/detail/1699477947753373144)

## Conclusion

That's all for now. I have so many plans for 2020 and the coming years. The next post will likely be the release of the Detective Butler DLC, so please look forward to it! Thank you for reading, and see you next time!
