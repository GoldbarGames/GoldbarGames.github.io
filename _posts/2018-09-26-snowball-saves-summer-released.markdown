# Overview

It's been a while since the last blog post, but that doesn't mean we've been sitting around doing nothing. We've actually been posting weekly updates on our Patreon and daily updates on our Twitch channel. So check those out if you want some more frequent news... or just stick around here and wait for the important stuff!

As you might have guessed from the title, Snowball Saves Summer is released! We worked all summer on that game (a little bit of Spring and almost Fall too) so we've all put a lot of effort into it. Go and check it out if you haven't already!

# Commissions

We'll be using the revenue from Snowball for a number of things, but a big one will be for funding our commissions for Detective Butler 2. Generally, we want to get into the habit of taking revenue from previous games and using them to fund new games. So hopefully we also get into the habit of turning a profit on each game, each one allowing us to make bigger and better games... almost like a snowball effect.

Additionally, I've been doing freelance programming work on the side, though that's mainly gone to my personal finances. I've got a few things lined up for October on that front, so some of my time will be dedicated to that. But with any extra money I make, I'd love to invest it into my own business, so I'm looking forward to taking care of those commissions soon. Plus, it helps me develop skills that can be put toward my own games, so it's a really useful side job.

# Our Next Game

I've tossed around a bunch of ideas on stream for our next game. We need to aim at something a bit smaller this time -- not 6 months, more like 3 at most. But we should also try to improve our skills a bit by going into unexplored territory. So my main concept is to have some sort of small multiplayer game. We've also had ideas for a shoot'em up game and survival horror, and honestly I think I've got an idea that can combine all of them together... but I'll have to hold off until the next blog post before I announce the details. I want to talk it over with everyone first and see what we can come up with. 

# Conclusion

If you'd like to be part of the discussion, feel free to join our Twitch streams or Discord channel and chat directly with us about it! Feedback is extremely useful during game development. I can certainly say that Snowball would be a very different (much worse) game without the feedback we received from our viewers and testers over the past few months. So thank you to everyone who has supported us thus far. We're moving up, hopefully at a faster and faster pace, and who knows where we'll go next!

(That's enough talking... Just go and play Snowball already! Have fun!!!)
