Let's start off the new year strong with a big announcement, shall we?

Detective Butler: Maiden Voyage Murder is now on Steam Greenlight! Not only that, but we've updated the game to fix any and all typing mistakes, generally improve the writing, and add a special extended ending and epilogue. We've taken players' critiques seriously and believe we have a much stronger game now, so please try it out. Even if you have already played the game when it first came out, you might find it worth replaying!
