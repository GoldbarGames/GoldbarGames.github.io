I like game jams. They're a great idea because they can lead to even better ideas for games. For instance, my attempt at Ludum Dare 30, a VN engine, inspired me to start working on Detective Butler's game engine in Unity. Similarly, Ludum Dare 33's game jam inspired me to create a 2D map generator, which gave me the confidence to try my hand at the 3D map generator. Even if you don't finish a game, you learn valuable skills that can be applied to later ones.

I really wanted to participate in game jams such as SuNoFes and Yuri Jam. Unfortunately, I just don't have the free time anymore (and school comes first!). As a solution, we have started what is called "Goldbar Game Jams". These are special game jams that take place amongst ourselves only when they are convenient for us. The idea is to finish a game, or at least part of one, within a very short amount of time. The result will be that we've learned something of value that we can apply to bigger projects, and have something small to show for our work.

It's all about working on small steps over a long period of time. Eventually, they do add up. So for our first game jam, we decided to do a very simple Tic-Tac-Toe game. The rules to this game are incredibly simple and finite, which makes it easy to program. At this time we've invested very few hours total into the programming and artwork. If it takes too long to finish, we'll just move on to bigger and better things.

Note: We will probably periodically update each mini-game as we continue working on them, but there's no harm in showing off our works in progress.
