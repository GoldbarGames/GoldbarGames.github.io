Once again, progress is kind of slow due to my day job, but fortunately I am still getting some pretty significant things accomplished. Here's a quick rundown:

* Snowball Saves Christmas has returned to Google Play and is now also available on the Amazon App Store!

* Currently working on the Detective Butler DLC. I recovered a bunch of old documents and photos from way back in 2013 and that gives me a lot of material for new content. I will probably make a formal announcement in the next 2 weeks, but I really think I can release it before the end of the year. I can't go a whole year without releasing anything new!

* The C++ game engine has reached a point to where we have been designing levels on the streams. We fixed many bugs and now the physics system is feeling pretty great! The next step is to improve the graphics rendering stuff, but we can probably afford to put out a demo first. Still, I need to prioritize Detective Butler DLC, so this won't happen until early next year.

* I have continued uploading programming tutorials on YouTube and Bitchute. More content will be uploaded next year -- I have so many ideas!

* I have finally added merchandise to the Kaneko section of the Goldbar Games Store! Plus a few items in the other categories as well.

* We have still been getting purchases for Snowball Saves Summer, and will be nearing another payout soon... so thank you to everyone who has been playing it! It's amazing to see  that people are still buying it even months after its release. I still see comments asking about Detective Butler, too. So I hear you, and I'm doing my best for you guys!

* Our Twitch streams are gaining traction, as we are gaining more paying subscribers at a faster rate... so thank you to everyone who watches the streams!

As always, thanks for all your support!
