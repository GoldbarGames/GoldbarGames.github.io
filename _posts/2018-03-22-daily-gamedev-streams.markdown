## Overview

Just a short post for today.

As the writing and gameplay elements for Detective Butler 2 are being finalized, we also need to secure funds to commission the remaining art and music assets. So, we're going to release a short project on Steam: the sequel to Snowball Saves Christmas. We plan to release it as quickly as we can without rushing it, so it will likely be during summer.

We're also going to be livestreaming its development, so be sure to tune in to our [Twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/goldbargames) every weeknight (Monday through Friday) at 8 PM Central Standard Time. We'll go for at least two hours per night. Some parts of the game will likely be coded off-stream as well, but at least this way you can share the excitement of watching the game come to life.

Lastly, don't forget you can speed the process up by donating to our [Patreon](https://patreon.com/goldbargames) or buying merchandise from the [Goldbar Games Store.](https://store.goldbargames.com)

Thank you for your support. And remember to have fun!
