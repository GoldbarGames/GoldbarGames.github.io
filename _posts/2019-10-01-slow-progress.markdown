Currently, we have gotten the level editor to a point where it is being used to make levels, and our intent is to make some sort of playable prototype of Witch Doctor Kaneko. Hopefully, we can release something soon (within the next month or so).

Earlier this month, I finally started uploading video tutorials. If you want to learn how to code, check out Kinjo Codes on YouTube. I might even try other video content eventually, once I get better. My intent right now is to just get stuff out there and learn by doing, so I'm sure if quality seems amateurish right now, it'll get better later.

I am also still working on the Detective Butler DLC, and getting Snowball Saves Christmas published on some more stores. This is in addition to everything I need to do IRL, so progress has been depressingly slow.

But, I generally have an optimistic view of the future. I have a lot of plans, and next year we'll be able to start seeing them in motion. I am continuing to improve all of my skills, even the ones I didn't know I had, and I literally can't wait to bring all my ideas to life.

As always, thanks for all your support!
