During the month of August, we worked mainly on improving and finishing Witch Doctor Kaneko's level editor. We added buttons to place doors and ladders, and can switch between different grids and tilesets for a variety of sprites and placements.

We also fixed some memory leaks and learned how to optimize SDL's textures for minimal memory consumption. While our previous build in Unity required nearly 250 MB of RAM, our custom C++ engine now only requires a little less than 50 MB! That means slower computers with less RAM will have an easier time running our game.

Additionally, our game engine also saves us some disk space -- our Unity build was 322 MB versus our new size of only 58 MB (both sizes include graphics and music assets).

In September, we plan to return to designing levels in the new game engine. We'll be making the cutscene system (also for talking with NPCs), creating the title screen, and saving game data.

Also, I will briefly mention that I've been working on a new video series for learning programming for beginners. We get a lot of people asking us during our streams for a tutorial like that, so I think it's the perfect opportunity. That said,  I don't have much time to dedicate to much of anything these days, but I've been working my hardest to get it off the ground as soon as possible.

Lastly, I've also been doing some more work regarding Butler and Snowball, so... even if it might take a while, please understand that one person can only do so much. If I had more time I would be doing so many things, but that's not an option right now. I've even asked a few others for help with the stuff I usually do alone, because I think I'll need to be doing that in the future if I want to get everything done. But just know that I'm giving it my best.

As always, thank you for your support, and see you next time!
