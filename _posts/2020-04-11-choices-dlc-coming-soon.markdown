## Overview

Hey, everyone. It's been another few months without any updates, so sorry for that. There's been a lot going on in the recent months, which has made it difficult for us to accomplish much. Fortunately, the coronavirus pandemic has not really affected us negatively, but it has obviously changed the world quite a bit in a short amount of time, so we've had to adapt accordingly.

## Detective Butler DLC Release Date Changed

In the previous blog post we announced a release date of April 3, 2020. We thought we'd be able to have it finished by then, but unfortunately, we weren't. We tried giving it an extra week, extending it to April 10th, but that didn't pan out either. That said, it's very, very close to being ready. It's just going through final rounds of testing and making sure all of the routes work properly and cover everything they need to cover. We needed more time for testing than we realized and should've picked a date closer toward the end of April rather than toward the beginning. Although two weeks technically isn't very long of a wait, I know there are a lot of people looking forward to this and that I could've done a much better job managing it, so I'm still really sorry.

The truly final release date has been postponed to April 27th, 2020. You can wishlist the game (and eventually purchase it) via its [Steam store page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1110930/Detective_Butler_Maiden_Voyage_Murder__Choices_DLC/). You can choose to purchase the game via the [itch.io store page](https://goldbargames.itch.io/detective-butler-maiden-voyage-murder-choices-dlc) as well.

## Streams

Streaming has been effectively put on hold until after the DLC releases. We need to make sure our attention is focused entirely on the DLC to ensure that it is up to our standards and will be a great experience for everyone.

## Conclusion

Lastly, I want to mention that even with such a limited amount of time to work on the DLC, it has been truly enjoyable to work on Detective Butler again. I had been working on Detective Butler 2 for such a long time that I really just needed a break from visual novels in general, but working on this game has brought back so many fun memories and makes me excited to create more fun stories. I had lost a lot of confidence in myself over the years, but I've realized that as long as I'm having fun writing it, people will likely have fun reading it. So I hope you will have fun playing the DLC when it comes out, and if not, we'll have other games that are more your style some other time.

As always, thank you for reading, and see you next time!
