Firstly, I'd like to start this off by announcing that, after five weeks on Steam Greenlight, Detective Butler: Maiden Voyage Murder has been greenlit! Thank you all so much -- we couldn't have done this without your support!
 As the game is already complete, I will be doing my best to quickly publish it on Steam. I don't think it will take very long, but I will be going through the game several more times to check for any potential problems.
 
Aside from that, I want to mention a new Android app I've created called "Seacats Mobile." It allows you to easily view the website seacats.net, on which many Umineko fan-gameboards are hosted. I will be adding posting functionality later on, but right now it works great as a reader. Eventually it will have its own page, but for now you can download the APK file here:

## [Download Seacats Mobile](https://play.goldbargames.com/downloads/seacats-mobile.apk)

Simply connect your Android smartphone to your computer via USB cable and drag and drop the APK file into your phone. It should automatically install.

Let me know if you have any questions or comments! Enjoy!
