## Overview

At long last, the [Detective Butler Choices DLC](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1110930/Detective_Butler_Maiden_Voyage_Murder__Choices_DLC/) is available for purchase! This additional content adds choices and branching paths to the game, which ultimately reveal the answers to several mysteries that the original story left unresolved. We have also posted a discussion thread and walkthrough guide. We know it has been a long time waiting, so we hope you enjoy it!

The DLC contains roughly the same wordcount as the original game, so it should take a few hours to get through. Especially because a number of endings are spread out across different routes, you might need to go back and try picking different choices in order to see all of them, including the "true" ending.

Ultimately, it was a lot of fun revisiting this game, and we could have taken the story in so many different directions. It's likely we will add even more choices in future updates, as a way to continue to delivering fresh content for Maiden Voyage Murder. But at this point our time would probably be better spent focusing on the next game.

For Detective Butler 2, we'll be introducing lots of new characters in a brand-new setting with new mysteries to solve. We also have some unique gameplay ideas never before seen in detective games that we'd like to try out. Our development process will include more frequent updates and playable demos early on. We want to keep people involved and excited about our future games.

## What Comes Next

Lastly, I want to mention that even with such a limited amount of time to work on the DLC, it has been truly enjoyable to work on Detective Butler again. I had been working on Detective Butler 2 for such a long time that I really just needed a break from visual novels in general, but working on this game has brought back so many fun memories and makes me excited to create more fun stories. I had lost a lot of confidence in myself over the years, but I've realized that as long as I'm having fun writing it, people will likely have fun reading it. So I hope you will have fun playing the DLC when it comes out, and if not, we'll have other games that are more your style some other time.

Thank you all for your support, and we hope to have more news soon!
