## Overview

*Space Racketeers* is a strategy / party game currently in development. As a member of a fearsome gang of space pirates, you must travel across several galaxies and capture the most planets among your crew. The gang member with the most planets captured is declared the winner!

Every time you capture a planet, you extort wealth from the population, and can use it to your advantage. You can spend money to attack other planets, or upgrade your equipment and attack other players directly!
