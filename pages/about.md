Goldbar Games LLC is an independent company dedicated to creating fun and engaging video game experiences. 

The founder of the company, Anton M. Strickland, has a great passion for making video game, and recently graduated with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science. From 2010 to 2011, he released a positively-received series of fan-games under the alias Kinjo Goldbar, so he named this development group after the pseudonym.

At Goldbar Games, we're committed to raising the bar. We value quality in games and efficiency in making them. <br/>By working hard, working smart, and working together, anything can be achieved.

Each game has its own individual page, with a full list of collaborators who worked on that game.
