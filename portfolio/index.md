Here is a portfolio of small games that I programmed in Unity. These are mostly just concepts, usually made within a single weekend and show off potential ideas for more fully realized games. All games can be played directly in your browser using WebGL.

# Tic Tac Toe

A simple tic tac toe simulation game. Play against an AI or with a second player locally.

# Werewolf

This game takes place on a top-down procedurally generated map. The idea was created for Ludum Dare 33, which had the theme "you are the monster." In this game, you alternate between being a human and a werewolf depending on the time of day. When you are a human, you must run away from the pilgrims, but when you are a werewolf you must eat them. After eating all the pilgrims in a level, a new level is procedurally generated with even more pilgrims than before.

# Space Shooter

This game was developed for testing on Android devices. The idea is that you can move your space ship by touching the screen and dragging it, but you can also move it with the mouse if you are playing it on the computer. You must shoot through wave after wave of enemy ships until you lose. Try to improve on your score!
