Witch Doctor Kaneko is a fantasy-themed puzzle-platformer game that began production in 2014 and is still in progress. The game is about a witch-doctor named Kaneko whose forest is one-day attacked by a mysterious swarm of bugs. She must cast her magical Debug spell to rid the forest of all the bugs and restore order.

The game will have a Metroidvania-style map, taking much of its inspiration from Kirby's Great Cave Offensive. Players will be able to roam the forest and solve puzzles using their magic to recover pages from Kaneko's spellbook, allowing her to cast more powerful spells that can defeat the various types of bugs Kaneko will encounter.

The idea was conceived in late-2013 and production finally began in mid-2014. The project was then put on hold in late-2014 due to Detective Butler taking precedence. Although art is still currently being produced, Witch Doctor Kaneko will resume Goldbar Games' full attention in late-2016.
